  <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Safety as a Human Right</h2>
  <p>
    After nearly 30 years in HSE, I came to a deeper realization: safety is not just a tool to reduce invisible cost—it is a nonalienable human right. Every worker deserves to return home safely, not because it’s efficient, but because they are human.
  </p>
  <p>
    This belief guided my final years at company, where I trained over 180 new employees. I asked them: “Why safety?” The answer I offered was simple—because every human being has the right to life, dignity, and reunion with their family. This message resonated deeply, regardless of background or education.
  </p>
  <p>
    Safety is not a business strategy. It is a moral commitment. When we see workers not as tools, but as people with inherent worth, the path forward becomes clear. This is the legacy I leave behind—and the message I now carry forward.
