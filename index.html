         <h1>Safety as a Human Right</h1>
    <p>After nearly 30 years in HSE service, I would like to share my realization: safety is not merely a tool to reduce invisible costs — it is a nonalienable human right. Every worker deserves to go home safely.</p>
    <p>“Safety first” is not a commitment to production; it is a commitment to respecting humanity. This conviction shaped my final years of service, during which I trained over 180 new employees. I often asked them, “Why safety?” The answers varied. But after asking “why” five times, the truth emerged: it’s the right thing to do.</p>
    <p>There is nothing wrong with appreciating that zero harm guarantees production. But beyond production lies a deeper, value-centered pursuit: no harm to workers because they are human. We are human.</p>
    <p>Safety is not a business strategy — it is a right. Life matters. When we see workers not as instruments of productivity but as individuals with inherent worth, the path forward becomes clear.</p>
    <p>This is the message I now carry forward and share with you all.</p>
